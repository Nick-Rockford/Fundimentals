/* Fifth thing for this video, and damn im glad i learned the basics of java first. woo! this all made sense!
*let add = 1 + 2;
*let sub = 2-1 ;
*let mult = 2 * 4;
*let division = 4 / 2;
*let mod = 5 % 2;
*
*let string = "String 1 " + "String 2";
*
*console.log(mod);

/*

/* forth thing. basically the same thing as thing 3
*let var1 = "2";
*let var2 = 5;
*let result = var1 + var2;
*
*console.log(result);
*/

/* Third thing. if you try to do an operation on an incompatible data type, JS will try to find a compatible type that does work.
*let var1 = 2;
*let var2 = 5;
*let result = var1 + var2;
*
*console.log(result);

/* This is the second thing they had me make
*let obj = {
*    key1: "Value 1",
*    key2: 3,
*    obj2: {
*        obj2Key1 : "value of inner object",
*    },
*};
*
*console.log(obj.obj2.obj2Key1);

/* This is the first set of stuff they had me make, and then just erased it.
